## Description

_ Rather than telling prospective employers about about my skills, I created a portfolio to show them. This portfolio website acts as a showcase of previous work samples, but I hope this site is another demonstration of what I am capable of.

Furthermore, I believe this to be another opportunity outside of my resume to express my personality and highlight critical soft skills too. I hope this gives employers a better understanding of how I may fit in with their existing company culture or whether I’d succeed in the role they’re looking to fill._
